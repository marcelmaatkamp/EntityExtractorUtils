In December 2010, the Amsterdam-Amstelland Regional Police initiated an investigation into Roberts MIKELSONS, born in Riga on 14 September 1983, who is suspected of the sexual abuse of very young children and of the production, dissemination and possession of child pornographic material. In the course of the investigation, several digital data-carriers and administrative documents were seized and examined. This gave rise to the suspicion that Mikelsons is part of a a national or international network of individuals who produce, possess and distribute child pornographic material and possibly sexually abuse very young children. In order to identify the other persons who form part of this network, the Netherlands Police Agency's National Crime Squad launched Investigation Holitna on 3 January 2011. The investigation is headed by Meester L.J.A. van Zwieten and Meester I.C.M.E. Meissen, public prosecutors of the National Public Prosecutors' Office.
